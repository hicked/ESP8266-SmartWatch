# Styling guidelines

Please follow so code looks consistent :)

1. Variable names, methods and functions should be snake case and start with a lowercase. (Ex: variable_name and not variableName)
2. Static variables and constants may be all caps snake case.
3. Pointers, Double Pointers and References must be defined as: `type* name` (and not `type *name`).
